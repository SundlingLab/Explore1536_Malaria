## Abstract

Malaria can manifest as a spectrum of disease severity. To improve
clinical management and prevention, it is crucial to understand the
pathogenesis and host response. We analyzed 1,463 plasma proteins during
and after acute *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria in adult travelers and
linked responses to peripheral immune cells by integrating with
single-cell RNA-seq data from a subset of donors. We identified
significant perturbations in over 250 proteins with diverse origins,
including many not previously analyzed in malaria patients, such as
hormones, circulating receptors, and intracellular or membrane-bound
proteins from affected tissues. The protein profiles clustered
participants according to disease severity, which enabled us to identify
a compressed 10-protein signature that was highly enriched in more
severe malaria compared with mild malaria and other febrile infections.
This unique resource, which also includes an interactive platform to
explore the data, opens for new hypotheses, biomarker discovery, and
potential drug target identification for malaria.

## Data availability statement 

Due to patient consent and confidentiality agreements, the data sets can
be made available for validation or re-usage by contacting the lead
contact. Data access will be evaluated according to the data access plan
and Swedish legislation. Source data are provided in this paper. For the
individual exploration of the proteomic data, we created a Shiny app,
sourcing pre-computed aggregated data that can be browsed online at
[malaria-proteomics-resource.serve.scilifelab.se](https://malaria-proteomics-resource.serve.scilifelab.se/app/malaria-proteomics-resource).

Moreover, the measured proteins are also visualized on the individual protein summary pages of
the [Human Disease Blood Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/blood), an initiative to characterize blood
protein profiles across a multitude of diseases Human Disease Blood Atlas.

Request for data access can be made to Prof. Anna Färnert, Karolinska
Institutet, (for contact details, see the original study).

Additional data used:

- Consensus transcript expression level data set from the Human Protein
Atlas, summarizing expression per gene in 50 tissues based on
transcriptomics data from HPA and GTEx. Here, we used version 23.0 and
Ensembl version 109, retrieved [here](https://v23.proteinatlas.org/about/download).
